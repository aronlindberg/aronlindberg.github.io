<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I am a doctoral student in Management, Design, & Information Systems at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, working with Kalle Lyytinen. My main interest is human collaboration and ingenuity, especially as it is manifested in open innovation and other design contexts.</p>

<p>Additionally, I teach introduction to design & information systems to undergraduates, as well as research design and multivariate statistics in the Doctor of Management program at Case, where I also serve as a Methods Advisor to several students.</p>

<a name="research" class="anchor" href="#research"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research</h3>

<p>My research program focuses on the relationship between <strong><em>routines and innovation in design contexts</em></strong>, primarily those with “open source-like” characteristics. This involves understanding variables and phenomena such as routine variation, sequential structuring, structural evolution, and temporal modes and their impacts on design outcomes such as effective coordination, digital artifact innovation, and requirements computation.</p>
 
<p>To conduct this inquiry, I use both qualitative data and methods as well as digital trace data and computational techniques such as text mining, sequence-, cluster-, and social network analysis. Throughout the next few years I intend to continue developing this research program to make a cumulative contribution to the study of digitalized design routines.</p> 

<p>So far this has resulted in multiple ICIS, AOM, and HICSS papers, as well as two papers under review at ISR.</p>

<a name="teaching" class="anchor" href="#teaching"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Teaching</h3>

<p>Previously <strong><em>I have taught introduction to Information Systems, and currently I am teaching Business Analytics.</em></strong> I have also been active as a teaching assistant and quantitative methods advisor in my university’s Doctor of Management program. Practically, this means that I have been teaching research design and statistics at basic to advanced levels for the past three years. Hence, my previous teaching experience, coupled with the computational skills I utilize in my research, positions me well to teach substantive IS courses, as well as quantitative courses focused on business analytics.</p>

<p>As a teacher, I prefer an interactive format. Most often, this has meant allocating reading materials or homework assignments before classes, which we can then discuss and work through in a seminar or workshop format.</p>
