<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the Howe School of Business at Stevens Institute of Technology. My main interest is digital innovation, especially as it is manifested in open source software, open innovation and other design contexts.</p>

<h3>
<a name="research" class="anchor" href="#research"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research</h3>

<p>My research program focuses on the relationship between routines and innovation in design contexts, primarily those with “open source-like” characteristics. This involves understanding variables and phenomena such as routine variation, sequential structuring, structural evolution, and temporal modes and their impacts on design outcomes such as effective coordination, digital artifact innovation, and requirements computation.</p>

<p>To conduct this inquiry, I mainly use digital trace data and computational techniques such as text mining, sequence-, cluster-, and social network analysis. Throughout the next few years I intend to continue developing this research program to make a cumulative contribution to the study of digitalized design routines.</p>

<a name="joining-the-lab" class="anchor" href="#joining-the-lab"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Joining The Lab</h3>

<p>If you are interested in joining the lab there are multiple opportunities for data science-oriented research assistantships. In the lab we primarily work with R, Python, SQL, and MongoDB - in that order of preference. Please <a href="mailto:aron.lindberg@case.edu">email me</a> with your CV (focused on your technical skills) if you are interested in data science research assistantship.</p>
